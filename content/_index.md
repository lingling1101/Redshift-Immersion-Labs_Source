## Redshift Immersion Labs
**Amazon Redshift** is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse solution that offers high speed and uses columnar storage to minimize I/O, providing high data compression rates and fast performance. This workshop series provides a set of exercises to help users get started with the Redshift platform. It also illustrates many built-in features of the platform.

|     | Exercise Name                      | Description                                                                |
|-----|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Getting Started                    | Create a data warehouse and connect to the Query Editor                    |
| 2   | Table Design and Manual Load       | Create tables and load data manually                                       |
| 3   | Continuous Load - ELT              | Implement continuous loading using stored procedures                       |
| 4   | Data Sharing                       | Share data directly from the producer (serverless) to the consumer (provisioned cluster) |
| 5   | Machine Learning - Redshift ML     | Create a Machine Learning model using Redshift ML features                 |
| 6   | Data Lake Querying - Redshift Spectrum | Use Redshift Spectrum features to query data in an S3 data lake            |
| 7   | Operations                         | Explore Redshift monitoring, audit logging, RPU change management, and cost control limit settings |
